# Surf-Training

Surf-Training is a web application built using SpringBoot, Bootstrap, and Postgres. The project aims to create a website that allows users to participate in online video courses uploaded by instructors.

The system is designed so that any user, even if not registered, can view the homepage. Registered users have free access to all video courses and information about the various instructors who created the courses.

Registration in the system can be done through the system registration we have implemented.

The system includes various functionalities:

- For users:
  - View their own profile
  - View available courses and their respective lessons
  - View instructor profiles and their information
  - Filter instructors and video courses by different categories

- For administrators:
  - All functionalities listed above for users
  - Add, modify, and delete courses
  - Add, modify, and delete lessons
  - Add, modify, and delete instructors
